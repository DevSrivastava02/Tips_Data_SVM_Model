# Tips_Data_SVM_Model
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the popular Tips dataset to analyze and predict tipping behavior based on features like total bill, gender, and time. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and visualization of SVM decision boundaries.
